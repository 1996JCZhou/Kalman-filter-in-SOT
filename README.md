# Kalman-filter-in-SOT
Run the file "main_best_estimation_to_trace.py" to start tracking the best estimated object position in the video frames.
Or you can run the file "main_observation_to_trace.py" to start tracking all the observations for the target, which are provided by the detector.
As comparative experiments, we provide another file "only_observations_maximal_iou_matching.py" to show the effectivness of using the kalman filter in the object tracking tasks.
